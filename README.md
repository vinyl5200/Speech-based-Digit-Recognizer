# Speech-Based Digit Recognition System

This repository contains the implementation of a speech-based digit recognition system in C++. The system leverages advanced speech recognition techniques to accurately identify and classify spoken digits.

## Features

- **High Accuracy:** The system achieves an impressive accuracy of **99%** in recognizing spoken digits.
- **Efficient Recognition:** Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to process and classify spoken digits quickly and efficiently.
- **C++ Implementation:** Entirely implemented in C++ for performance optimization and flexibility.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

- . **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinyl5200/Speech_Based_Digit_Recognition.git
   cd Speech_Based_Digit_Recognition
   '''
   Building and Running the Project
Open the Solution File:

Navigate to the build directory.
Open the Speech_Based_Digit_Recognition.sln file using Visual Studio 2010.
Build the Solution:

In Visual Studio 2010, go to the "Build" menu and select "Build Solution" (or press F7).
Wait for the build process to complete. Ensure that there are no errors.
Run the Code:

After building the solution, go to the "Debug" menu and select "Start Debugging" (or press F5) to run the executable.
The program will start and you can test the speech-based digit recognition system.
